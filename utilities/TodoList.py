# TODO: save weights matrix to file (load weights matrix from file on start)
# TODO: save log of the prediction vector and other stats (every time program is run, every n iterations,...)
# TODO: maybe run on Wheeler...
# TODO: compute W matrix afterwards (just numpy array) -- AFTER cluster/client closes...
# TODO: maybe experiment so computation is completed after a few iterations...

# TODO: fix parent directory

# TODO: prediction on entire matrix instead of just a data row
# TODO: get validation accuracy and do early termination (based on prev BEST accuracy)
# TODO: get testing accuracy AND save into file

# Notes

# use dictionaries more...lessen use of if statement checking
# maybe look at exceptions more...and create custom exceptions/errors
# training/validation objects/class...
